1.Use makeMol.py to make and duplicate the molecules into a single gro file, say, ini.gro
  Note that normally the orinigal gro files should contain only one molecule per file
2.Use editconf to format the ini.gro 
3.Use makeDest.py to create a dest.xyz file containing the desired position coordinates in each line
4.Use arrange.tcl to arrange those molecules in ini.gro into the corresponding positions in dest.xyz
